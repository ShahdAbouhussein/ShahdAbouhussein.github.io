# Can Age, Gender, Location, and Season Predict What You'll Buy? A Machine Learning Analysis of Retail Purchase Patterns

## Abstract
This project applies Random Forest classification to predict shopping categories from demographic features using 3,900 customer transactions. By grouping 25 specific items into 5 semantic categories (Footwear, Tops, Bottoms, Outerwear, Accessories) and using 4 predictors (Age, Gender, Location, Season), the model achieved 20.77% test accuracy, a 4-fold improvement over baseline. Through iterative development across 4 versions, overfitting was reduced from 84% to 29%. Additionally, feature importance analysis revealed Age (42%) and Location (40%) as dominant predictors, while Gender (5%) showed minimal influence. The key finding is methodological: semantic item grouping provided far greater performance gains than hyperparameter optimization alone, demonstrating that thoughtful problem formulation often matters more than algorithmic sophistication when working with limited features.
